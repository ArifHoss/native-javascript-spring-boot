Getting Started

Prerequisites

	â€¢	A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
	â€¢	A basic HTTP server to serve the project files (e.g., VS Code Live Server, Node.js with http-server, or Pythonâ€™s SimpleHTTPServer).

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

Usage

	1.	Open index.html in your web browser.
	2.	Use the Add New Book button to add books.
	3.	Search, filter, and sort books using the controls at the top of the page.
	4.	Click on a book card to view more details in a modal.
	5.	Delete a book by clicking the Delete button in the modal.

API Endpoints

	â€¢	Base URL: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/books
	â€¢	GET /books: Retrieve all books.
	â€¢	POST /books: Add a new book. (Requires title, description, releaseDate, pages, and genre in the body.)
	â€¢	DELETE /books/:id: Delete a book by its ID.

Known Issues

	â€¢	The delete functionality might fail due to incorrect variable reference or API endpoint mismatch. Ensure that the id passed to the delete function matches the backendâ€™s expected parameter.
	â€¢	Missing book cover images default to a placeholder.

Future Improvements

	â€¢	Add an Edit Book feature.
	â€¢	Implement user authentication for CRUD operations.
	â€¢	Save data to a persistent backend or database.
	â€¢	Enhance the UI with custom animations and transitions.
	â€¢	Improve error handling and display error messages to the user.


# Books Database Application ðŸ“š

This is a Spring Boot application for managing a database of books, built with Java, Maven, and PostgreSQL. The application is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment and scaling.

Features

	â€¢	RESTful APIs: Manage books with endpoints for CRUD operations.
	â€¢	PostgreSQL Integration: A relational database for storing book data.
	â€¢	Dockerized Deployment: Simplified setup with Docker and Docker Compose.
	â€¢	Configuration with Spring: Easy database configuration via environment variables.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

	â€¢	Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

Steps to Run the Application

	1.	Clone the repository:


	2.	Build and start the application:

docker-compose up --build


	3.	Access the application:
	â€¢	Backend: The Spring Boot app runs on http://127.0.0.1:8080.
	â€¢	Database: PostgreSQL is exposed on port 5432.

Project Structure

	â€¢	Docker Compose: Orchestrates the app and database containers.
	â€¢	Dockerfile: Multi-stage build to create a lightweight image for the app.
	â€¢	PostgreSQL Database: Configured with environment variables.
	â€¢	Spring Boot: Handles application logic and API endpoints.

Configuration

Environment variables in docker-compose.yml control database connectivity:

	â€¢	SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: JDBC URL for PostgreSQL.
	â€¢	SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: Database username.
	â€¢	SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: Database password.

Future Improvements

	â€¢	Add API documentation (e.g., Swagger).
	â€¢	Implement unit and integration tests.
	â€¢	Add CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
